# REST API using MVC Design Pattern

**MVC** is a design pattern used in software development that separates the application logic into three interconnected components: the Model, the View, and the Controller. Here's a brief overview of each component:

**Model**: The Model represents the data and the business logic of the application. It encapsulates the data and provides methods to access and manipulate it.

**View**: The View is responsible for presenting the data to the user and handling user input. It provides an interface for the user to interact with the application.

**Controller**: The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It receives input from the View, interacts with the Model to retrieve or modify data, and updates the View accordingly.



This branch contains all the code examples of MVC pattern including a REST API in API folder

For runnning this REST Program:
